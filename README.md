Powers And Attributes:

Cloudlike: As you are part cloud, you have inherited the ability to fly for a short period of time, but if you are wearing heavy armor you wont be able to stay in the air for very long.

From The Sky: Your home is the sky, so you are only able to sleep when you are above y level 100 and exposed to it, but being high up will give you regeneration.

Light As Air: If you aren't wearing heavy armor you will run faster and jump higher, which will increases when you are above y level 100.

Natural Evaporation: Because you are a cloud, tropical biomes with high humidity will make you stronger.

Soft Stomach: Your stomach can't handle meat, so it's probably best you stick to eating other things.

Weak: You are naturally weaker. As a result of this you are unable to use shields and you have 2 less hearts.
